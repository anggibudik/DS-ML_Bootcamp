# Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp (AnggiBK)
 
 This is the repository of my individual record for one of data science bootcamp that I enrolled in. The online bootcamp is taught by Jose Portilla on Udemy, titled [***Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp***](udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp)
 
 The records (i.e. scripts) are written mostly on Jupyter notebook. Some are written directly on python extension format (.py).
 The files are arranged and numbered based on the order of the lecture.<br>
 This repository will be updated constantly based on the progress and (technically) finished when I finish the course.
