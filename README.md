# DS-ML_Bootcamp
 
 This is the repository of my individual record for one of data science bootcamp that I enrolled in. The online bootcamp is taught by Jose Portilla on Udemy, titled "<b>Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp</b>"
 
 The records a.k.a scripts are written mostly on Jupyter notebook. Some are written directly on python extension.
 The files are arranged and numbered based on the order of the lecture.
